# Mjolnir
Text Editor, Music Player, Image Viewer, and more!

Mjolnir is a very large integrated application environment I use to host a number of built in application types...

1) Text editor. Uniscribe and FreeType2
2) Music Player. Windows and Alsa.
3) Image Viewer
4) Morse Code practice system.

Mjolnir at a base level supports a built in text parser, with plug in language grammars to support the various applications. The environment is modeled after the classic Model/View/Controller design pattern. 

It is currently a Windows Forms application. However I am in the process of converting from GDI+ to SkiaSharp for all graphics operations. I expect I will convert from Windows Forms to Gnome, but that's still just in planning.

Use at your own risk. I can't guarantee that this program won't fold, spindle and or mutilate your data!
